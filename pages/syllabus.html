      <hr />

      <p>There are two sections of CS 357:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Section N: In-person, TR 11:00am - 12:15pm CT, CIF 0035</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Section M: Online, TR 11:00am - 12:15pm CT (no assigned classroom)</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>ALL students will have to complete the SAME assessments via PrairieLearn: homework, quizzes, group activities, machine problems. CS 357 is a flipped course, thus all course content will be delivered via pre-recorded videos. <strong>There will be no difference regarding course material or evaluation between these sections.</strong></p>

      <p>The only difference between these sections is the scheduling and location of the weekly group activities:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Section N</strong>: students will complete all group assessments in the classroom, during lecture time on Tuesdays. <strong>Classroom attendance is required.</strong> In case students cannot complete the task during class time, they will be able to make submissions outside of the class until 10pm.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Section M</strong>: students will complete all group assessments on Tuesdays anytime between 11am to 10pm, however they will be <strong>highly</strong> encouraged to complete the group assessments during class time. Student groups will select the location to meet: they can complete the assessments remotely, or they can select their favorite location to meet in-person. Since section M runs completely asynchronous, students in this section do not have any attendance requirement.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>You must read the <a href="/pages/lectures.html">Group Activities page</a> to get additional information.</p>

      <p><strong>For the first 2 classes (week 1), all students will be expected to join class synchronously, whether in person (CIF 35) or connect remotely via <a href="https://illinois.zoom.us/j/89451997488?pwd=TFJITnhwVy9KMXg4WjFhc2RzQW9qQT09">Zoom Meeting</a></strong></p>

      <p>You should be able to calculate your own grade based on the information above. We reserve the right to lower these thresholds but we will never raise them. We will <strong>never round grades</strong>.</p>

      <p>The top 5% students will receive an A+ (assuming that they all have 97 points or above, otherwise, all students with total points above 97 will receive an A+).</p>

      <h3 id="general-rules">General Rules</h3>

      <p>Any questions, concerns, or misgivings regarding a specific
grade must be raised <strong>within one week of the due date or the date the grade is released</strong>.  After one week has passed, the assigned
grade is considered accepted and no further complaints will be
considered.</p>

      <h3 id="late-adds">Late Adds</h3>

      <p>All course material is accessible to all students, independent of registration status. Students who plan to add the class late are expected to keep up with the content. No special accommodations will be provided for students who add the course late.</p>

      <p><a name="programming-languages"></a></p>

      <h1 id="programming-languages">Programming Languages</h1>
      <hr />

      <p>We will be using <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> with the libraries
<a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/">numpy</a>,
<a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/">scipy</a> and
<a href="http://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> for in-class work and
assignments. No other languages are permitted. Python has a very
gentle learning curve, so you should feel at home even if you’ve
never done any work in Python.</p>

      <h3 id="which-python-should-you-use">Which Python should you use?</h3>

      <p>For the homework assignments and quizzes, the coding can be done directly
on PrairieLearn. Class demos will use
Python 3 in a <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> notebook.</p>

      <p>You don’t need to install Python on your own device, since we will be providing a Jupyter notebook 
from inside PrairieLearn, so you can complete all your assignments. However, if you wish to install Python and the Numpy+Scipy+Matplotlib stack, you
are free to do so in any way that works.  We recommend using
<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">Anaconda</a>, which
is a (free) Python distribution that includes Numpy+Scipy+Matplotlib.
In addition, you should use <strong>Python 3</strong>.</p>

      <p>The course staff has created a short <strong>Python tutorial</strong> that is available as a PrairieLearn assessment,
for students that have not worked with Python before, or need some brushing up.</p>

      <p><br /></p>

      <p><a name="lectures"></a></p>
      <h1 id="pre-lecture-activities">Pre-Lecture Activities</h1>
      <hr />

      <p>You will complete two weekly pre-lecture assignments, corresponding to the Tuesdays and Thursdays lectures, which will appear in PrairieLearn with the label <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">L#</code>. You can find all the topics listed on the <a href="/pages/schedule.html">Schedule page</a>.</p>

      <p>Each assignment will consist of short to medium size videos, and short questions corresponding to the video content. These are short activities that should be completed on the day they are open (Tuesdays and Thursdays), but they can be completed for 100% credit by the following Tuesday at the start of the class time. This schedule will ensure students complete watching the relevant material for the group activity on Tuesdays.</p>

      <p>If you don’t complete the pre-lecture activities before the Tuesday deadline, you have two other late deadlines for reduced credit:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>80% credit if you complete the pre-lecture before the Tuesday of the quiz week that covers that topic;</li>
        <li>50% credit if you complete the pre-lecture before the last day of classes.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You can find all the due dates directly in PrairieLearn. <strong>You are strongly 
encouraged to complete all your pre-lectures by the 100% deadline,</strong> to ensure you are ready to participate in the Tuesday group activities.</p>

      <p>The 4 lowest scores will be dropped. The remaining assignments combined will count towards 4% of your final grade.</p>

      <p><strong>The first two lectures will be offered synchronously in hybrid format.</strong> Attendance is required, both in-person from CIF and online via Discord.</p>

      <p><br /></p>

      <hr />

      <h3 id="tuesdays-group-activities">Tuesdays: Group Activities</h3>

      <p>Students will be placed in groups of 2-3, and they will work together to complete an assignment delivered via PrairieLearn with the label <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GA#</code>. Groups will be only formed starting from week 3, and students will have the opportunity to create their own groups during the first two weeks. Make sure to not miss the first two weeks of classes, so you can meet students during class before selecting your teams!</p>

      <p>Students in section N (in-person) will complete this activity on Tuesdays in the classroom during lecture time. Attendance is required.</p>

      <p>Students in section M (online) will complete this activity remotely, at a time and location of their choice. We will provide online support during class time via Discord. Attendance is not required.</p>

      <p>You can find more
information about the group activities and attendance requirements in the <a href="/pages/lectures.html">Group Activities</a>
page.</p>

      <p>The lowest score will be dropped. The remaining assignments combined will count towards 11% of your final grade.</p>

      <h3 id="thursdays-optional-study-hour">Thursdays: Optional Study Hour</h3>

      <p>We cancel six Thursday classes during the semester to compensate for the time you spend taking quizzes at the CBTF (check the <a href="/pages/schedule.html">Schedule page</a>).</p>

      <p>On the other Thursdays, we use the lecture time as <strong>Optional</strong> Study Hours. Note that <strong>we will not be covering new content during these classes</strong> (new content is only introduced during the asynchronous online recorded pre-lectures). We use these classes to go over examples and/or questions included in your PrairieLearn assessments, as well as the IPython (Jupyter) notebooks included in PrairieLearn labeled with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">D#</code>, which are sometimes covered in the pre-lecture videos. Students from both sections are welcome to join at CIF 0035. Since the study hours are optional, we always have enough space to accommodate all students who want to participate!</p>

      <p>Throughout the semester, you will take 6 quizzes (50-minute) that will have a mixture
of short questions and short coding questions (similar to the questions that appear in your HW, L, GA and practice assessments).</p>

      <p>Quizzes will count towards 35% of your final grade and the lowest score will be dropped.</p>

      <p>Students <strong>from both sections</strong> will take quizzes at CBTF from Monday to Wednesday during a quiz week. Students must self-schedule via  <a href="https://www.prairietest.org/">PrairieTest</a>.</p>

      <p><br />
The <a href="/pages/quizzes.html">Quizzes</a> pages show the week designated for each quiz. Make sure to read the CBTF policies <a href="https://cbtf.illinois.edu/students">here</a>.</p>

      <p>You will have a Practice Quiz opening the week prior to each quiz. Your actual quiz will be generated using the same question pool used to generate the practice quizzes, with the exception of the coding questions. The practice quizzes will become unavailable on Fridays of the quiz week.</p>

      <p>Students that have DRES accommodations will need to provide their letter of accommodation to CBTF by the end of week 2. You can find more information at the <a href="https://cbtf.illinois.edu/students/dres">CBTF website</a>.</p>

      <p>Check the <a href="/pages/quizzes.html">Quizzes page</a> for more information.</p>

      <h1 id="how-should-i-use-the-course-resources">How should I use the course resources?</h1>
      <hr />

      <p>I often get this question from students: “How can I study for this course?”  I will give here my recommendation,
based on observations, my own experience as student, and feedback received over the years. Of course, every student is
different, and the recommendations below may not apply to you.</p>

      <p>1) Watch the pre-recorded videos and complete the short questions (PrairieLearn pre-lecture activities).
    Some students prefer to read instead of watching videos. If that is your case, you can take a look at the pre-lecture <b>slides</b>
    and/or <b>notes</b> from the <a href="/pages/resources.html">Resources page</a>.</p>

      <p>2) Start the homework AFTER you go over the course content and have a good understanding of the material. Use the homework to
      test your knowledge. Go back and review the concepts when you get questions marked as incorrect. I know it can be tempting to just
      keep trying until you get the question marked as correct (the so desirable PrairieLearn green badge!),
      but you will be missing the opportunity to actually learn from your mistakes.</p>

      <p>3) Watch the pre-recorded videos before the corresponding group activities. You will have more productive and interesting
conversations with your team mates if you know the content.</p>

      <p>4) When preparing for the quizzes, take a look at the <b>review questions</b> from the <a href="/pages/resources.html">Resources page</a>.
  They may help you figuring out what you know and what you still
need to learn. Go back to the videos, slides and/or notes from concepts that you have not mastered yet.</p>

      <p>5) You will have access to the <strong>Practice Quiz</strong> the week before the Quiz. Don’t start creating your Practice Quizzes until you completed the steps above. This is a great opportunity to really see how well you have learned the material before you take your actual quiz.</p>

      <h1 id="absences-and-missed-assessments">Absences and Missed Assessments</h1>
      <hr />

      <p>We have created a very flexible assessment schedule, with late deadlines and drops. As such, we will not give extensions to HWs, MPs and pre-lectures.</p>

      <p>Students can submit a request for excused absence (equivalent to a score getting dropped) if they are not able to attend the GAs or CBTF quizzes under the following circumstances:</p>

      <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>A.  Illness

B.  Personal crisis (e.g. car accident, required court appearance, death of a close relative).

C.  Required attendance at an official UIUC activity (e.g. varsity athletics, band concert).
</code></pre></div>      </div>

      <p>In all cases, you must fill out the <a href="https://forms.illinois.edu/sec/283880982">excused absence request form</a> 
and upload an appropriate documentation that verifies the reason for the request.
All approved excused assessments will be dropped from the final grade calculation.
If you have any further questions about excused absence, send us a message on Discord.</p>

      <!-- In cases (A) or (B) an official excuse letter from the
    [(Dean on Duty)](http://odos.illinois.edu/community-of-care/student-assistance-center/#dean-on-duty)
    must be uploaded with the form within 2 weeks of the due date
    of the missed assessment, no later than reading day. In cases of extended
    or unusual illness, late submission of excuse documentation will be
    considered.

In case (C) an official letter from the designated university official
    must be uploaded at least one week prior to
    the due date of the missed assessment. -->

      <hr />

      <p>The intent is to raise student and instructor awareness of the ongoing threat of bias and racism and of the need to take personal responsibility in creating an inclusive learning environment.</p>

      <p>The Grainger College of Engineering is committed to the creation of an anti-racist, inclusive community that welcomes diversity along a number of dimensions, including, but not limited to, race, ethnicity and national origins, gender and gender identity, sexuality, disability status, class, age, or religious beliefs. The College recognizes that we are learning together in the midst of the Black Lives Matter movement, that Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous voices and contributions have largely either been excluded from, or not recognized in, science and engineering, and that both overt racism and micro-aggressions threaten the well-being of our students and our university community.</p>

      <p>The effectiveness of this course is dependent upon each of us to create a safe and encouraging learning environment that allows for the open exchange of ideas while also ensuring equitable opportunities and respect for all of us. Everyone is expected to help establish and maintain an environment where students, staff, and faculty can contribute without fear of personal ridicule, or intolerant or offensive language. If you witness or experience racism, discrimination, micro-aggressions, or other offensive behavior, you are encouraged to bring this to the attention of the course director if you feel comfortable. You can also report these behaviors to the <a href="https://diversity.illinois.edu/diversity-campus-culture/belonging-resources/">Campus Belonging Team</a>.</p>

      <hr />

      <p>Students registered in the online section will complete all assessments online via PrairieLearn. This course uses a flipped format – there are no traditional lectures on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Instead, students complete pre-lecture assignments delivered online via PrairieLearn. On Tuesdays, students will complete a group assessment, which can be completed during lecture time (optional support from staff via online meeting) or can be completed at another time during the same day, upon agreement of group members. There will be weekly asynchronous quizzes at CBTF. To be approved for a time conflict override, students must understand it is their responsibility to find other students to complete the group activities on Tuesdays. If you agree with the terms above, you can contact the CS Advising Office directly to request time conflict override to register in the online section. They will process the override request. Note that students should not contact the professor to request the override approval.</p>
