<h1 id="fall-2021-information">Fall 2021 Information</h1>
<hr />

<p>This page has a draft for the Fall 2021 syllabus for CS 357. Note that this is a <strong>work-in-progress page</strong> and subjected to changes. The finalized syllabus will be available to students at the start of the semester.</p>

<p>We are making this page available to students at an earlier time to help them decide which section to enroll.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><a name="section"></a></p>
<h1 id="how-are-we-planning-the-return-to-campus">How are we planning the return to campus?</h1>
<hr />

<p>We will have two sections of CS 357 in the Fall 2021 semester:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Section M: Online, TR 12:30pm - 1:45pm</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section N: In-person, TR 12:30pm - 1:45pm, Location pending</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Students registered in either section will have to complete the SAME assessments via PrairieLearn: homework, quizzes, group activities, machine problems. All lecture content will be delivered via pre-recorded videos. <strong>There will be no difference regarding acess of material or course evaluation between these two sections.</strong></p>

<p>So what makes them different? The way students will interact to complete their weekly group assessments:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Section N: students will complete the group assessment in the classroom, during lecture time on Tuesdays. <strong>Attendance is required.</strong> The maximum capacity for this section will be 60 students, to accomodate the 50% maximum classroom capacity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Section M: students will complete the group assessment online via Zoom on Tuesdays. There will be an option to complete the activity during the 12:30pm (lecture time), or at other times during the day (for example 9am and 8pm). We are also exploring the option of making this activity completely asynchronous, where students can select a time to meet, but this will be decided at a later time, once we have more information about the software tools that we are developing for this class.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Historical data from CS 357 shows that about 20% of the students attend lectures, while the remaining students watch the recorded lectures online at their own convenience. Since all the assessments are offered online, many students feel like they don’t “need to attend lecture”. At this time of uncertainty, we decided to offer two sections of CS 357, so that we can accomodate the students that benefit from the in-person interactions, while maintaining the safety guidelines and providing the distance learning opportunity for students that cannot come back to campus.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><a name="override"></a></p>
<h1 id="time-conflict-overrides">Time conflict overrides</h1>
<hr />

<p>The online section will follow mostly an asynchronous schedule, with the exception of the quizzes that will happen 6 times during the semester on Thursdays during lecture time (12:30pm-1:45pm CST).</p>

<p>A conflict quiz will be offered later in the same day (likely at 8pm, but the actual time will be decided later) only for students with a valid reason, to be requested at the beginning of the semester. The valid reasons will include a reasonable difference in timezone or time conflict with another class. Students will need to provide documentation supporting their request for a conflict quiz.</p>

<p>Students that want to request time conflict overrides during registration must send an email to Prof. Silva (mfsilva@illinois.edu). Note that we will only approve time conflict overrides to students that indicate in writing they will be taking the quizzes during lecture time, or during the conflict time set by the instructor (which will only be confirmed later once the semester starts). If none of these times work, the student will not receive another opportunity to take the quiz and will receive a zero grade for that missed assessment.</p>

<p><a name="programming-languages"></a></p>

<h1 id="programming-languages">Programming Languages</h1>
<hr />

<p>We will be using <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> with the libraries
<a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/">numpy</a>,
<a href="http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/">scipy</a> and
<a href="http://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> for in-class work and
assignments. No other languages are permitted. Python has a very
gentle learning curve, so you should feel at home even if you’ve
never done any work in Python.</p>

<h3 id="which-python-should-you-use">Which Python should you use?</h3>

<p>For the homework assignments and quizzes, the coding can be done directly
on PrairieLearn. Class demos will use
Python 3 in a <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> notebook.</p>

<p>If you wish to install Python and the Numpy+Scipy+Matplotlib stack, you
are free to do so in any way that works.  We recommend using
<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">Anaconda</a>, which
is a (free) Python distribution that includes Numpy+Scipy+Matplotlib.
In addition, you should use <strong>Python 3</strong>.</p>

<p>The course staff has created a short <strong>Python tutorial</strong> that is available as a PrairieLearn assessment,
for students that have not worked with Python before, or need some brushing up.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><a name="lectures"></a></p>
<h1 id="lecture-activities">Lecture Activities</h1>
<hr />

<p>You will complete two weekly lecture assignments, corresponding to the Tuesdays and Thursdays lectures, which will appear in PrairieLearn with the label <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">L#</code>. You can find all the topics listed on the <a href="/pages/schedule.html">schedule page</a>.</p>

<p>Each assignment will consist of short to medium size videos, and short questions corresponding to the video content. These are short activities that should be completed on the day they are open (Tuesdays and Thursdays), but they can be completed for 100% credit by the following Tuesday at 9am. This schedule will ensure students complete watching the relevant material for the group activity on Tuesdays.
You can find all the due dates directly in PrairieLearn.</p>

<p>These assignments combined count towards 4% of your final grade. There will be a total of 24 lecture activities, and the lowest 4 scores will be dropped.</p>

<p><a name="ga"></a></p>
<h1 id="group-activities">Group activities</h1>
<hr />

<p>Students will be placed in groups of 3-4, and they will work together to complete an assignment delivered via PrairieLearn with the label <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GA#</code>. Groups will be only formed starting from week 3, hence for the first two weeks, the group activities will not count towards your final grade. However, these two first weeks give you a great opportunity to meet your peers and get familiar with the group logistics.</p>

<p>Students in the N section will complete this activity on Tuesdays during lecture time, and attendance is required. Students in the online section M will complete this activity remotely. There will be synchronous and asynchronous options. We are still figuring out some of the additional details.</p>

<p>These assignments combined count towards 11% of your final grade.
<!-- You can find more
information about the group activities in the <a href="/pages/collaborate.html">collaborate page</a> --></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><a name="homework"></a></p>
<h1 id="homework">Homework</h1>
<hr />

<p>The homework sets will be assigned via PrairieLearn  with the label <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HW#</code>.
The due dates are indicated both in PrairieLearn and also in the <a href="/pages/schedule.html">lecture schedule</a>
(the schedule may be subjected to changes during the semester). <strong>Each homework is due at 8pm on the due date.</strong>
If you don’t complete the homework by the recommended deadline, you can still complete it by the last day of classes for 96% credit.</p>

<p>In the PrairieLearn assessment page, if you click on the “?” just to the right of the line about available credit, you’ll see all the dates associated with this assessment, and how I am setting the credit:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>* You can receive 100% until Main End Date
* You can receive 96% until Late End Date
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The “Late End Date” corresponds to the last day of classes.</p>

<p>There will be a total of 20 individual HWs, combined they will count towards 25% of your final grade. The 2 lowest scores will be dropped.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><a name="machine"></a></p>
<h1 id="machine-problems">Machine Problems</h1>
<hr />

<p>There will be a total of 5 MPs assigned via PrairieLearn with the label <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MP#</code>. These are longer programming assignments.
The due dates are indicated in the <a href="/pages/schedule.html">lecture schedule</a> (the schedule may be subjected to changes during the semester).
<strong>Each MP is due at 8pm on the due date.</strong> If you don’t complete the MP by the recommended deadline, you can still complete it by the last day of classes for 96% credit.</p>

<p>If you click on the “?” just to the right of the line about available
credit, you’ll see all the dates associated with this assessment, and how I am setting the credit:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>* You can receive 100% until Main End Date
* You can receive 96% until Late End Date
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The “Late End Date” corresponds to the last day of classes.</p>

<p>There will be a total of 5 individual HWs, combined they will count towards 10% of your final grade. There is no drop of MP scores.</p>

<p><a name="quizzes_quizzes"></a></p>
<h1 id="quizzes--final-exam">Quizzes &amp; Final Exam</h1>
<hr />

<h3 id="quizzes">Quizzes</h3>

<p>Throughout the semester, you will take 6 quizzes (50-minute) that will have a mixture
of short questions and short coding questions (similar to the questions that appear in your HW, L, GA and practice assessments).</p>

<p>Quizzes will be scheduled on Thursdays during lecture time 12:30pm-1:45pm. Students with valid reason (for example, the ones located at a timezone) will be able to take the conflict quiz, which will be scheduled later in the same day (exact time to be determined, likely around 8pm Central Time).</p>

<p>More information to come.</p>

<!--You will have a Practice Quiz open 9 days prior to each quiz. Your actual quiz will be generated using the same question pool used to generate
the practice quizzes, with the exception of the coding questions.
Quizzes will count towards 35% of your final grade and the lowest score will be dropped.

**All quizzes will be taken remotely via PrairieLearn using the Grainger College of Engineering
Computer-Based
Testing Facility [(CBTF)](https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu) online service.** Make sure to read the CBTF-online [rules](https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu/cbtf-online/students/rules.html),  exam [instructions](https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu/cbtf-online/students/instructions.html) and what you need to do to [schedule](https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu/cbtf-online/students/preparation.html) your quiz.


These quizzes will follow the **[CS honors code](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/honor-code) and [UIUC Academic Integrity policies](https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-401/)**. You will be expected to comply with the Student Code, and the [rules of CBTF-online](https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu/cbtf-online/students/rules.html). The list below summarizes some of the guidelines provided on these other resources:

- you will **not** be allowed to use a tablet for note-taking.
- you will **not** be allowed to use physical books, notepads, or any type of printed or hand-written document.
- you can have BLANK papers within your reach.
- you can use any course content available on this website. However, note that you will not have access to your other PrairieLearn assessments (HWs and MPs). **I strongly suggest that you do not rely on finding relevant material during the time of your exam.** You will likely run out of time. You should prepare for the exam as you were taking it at the physical CBTF, when you don't have access to the course website.

<br/>

**You must not communicate with anyone about quiz content during the quiz period, which starts at 2pm Central Time on the exam day (Thursdays, as listed on the schedule) and finishes on 9:30am on the following day (Fridays).
All office hours will be also canceled during this period. No questions should be posted on CampusWire, or any other media,
discussing quiz content.**


Quizzes will have a time limit of 50 minutes. Students that have DRES accommodations at the CBTF will have their adjusted extended time. **Note that quizzes will automatically close at 10:30am or 1:30pm** (even if you didn't reach your time limit yet).

The <a href="/pages/schedule.html">schedule</a> page shows all quiz dates, which will happen on Thursdays during lecture time (2-2:50pm)
 Students that have conflict with their quiz time will be able to request to take the conflict quizzes, which are offered at 8pm Central Time (same day) or 8am Central Time (day after the quiz). These requests will be processed in the beginning of the semester, and remain the same throughout.

### Quiz review

When you finish your quiz, you will see the correct answers and your
score on the quiz. You
will **not have access to the quiz once your assigned quiz period is finished**.
If you want to talk about the quiz with the instructor or TA, you **must** wait until the quiz period is over, and then you can ask questions on <a href="">CampusWire</a>, or office hours.
You are not allowed to post screen shots of quiz questions on <a href="">CampusWire</a>. -->

<!-- After the quiz period has ended, you may come come to office
hours the following week (Monday-Friday) and ask specific questions
regarding the quiz.  After the Friday following the end of a specific quiz
period, no additional questions regarding the quiz will be addressed.  You
will need to bring specific questions about the quiz as the TAs and CAs will
**not** open your quiz and go through it with you. -->

<h3 id="final-exam">Final Exam</h3>

<!-- **The final exam will be taken remotely via PrairieLearn using the Grainger College of Engineering
Computer-Based
Testing Facility [(CBTF)](https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu) online service.** The exam will follow the **[CS honors code](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/honor-code) and [UIUC Academic Integrity policies](https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-401/).** -->

<p>The final exam will be scheduled during final exam week. We will release the dates and other information towards the middle of the semester.</p>

<!-- The final exam is scheduled using the [Non-Combined UIUC schedule](https://registrar.illinois.edu/fall-2020-final-exam-scheduling-guidelines/): -->

<!-- - Students registered in the **M section** (TTh 9:30-9:45pm): Friday, Dec 18, 1:30-4:30 p.m.

- Students registered in the **N section** (TTh 12:30pm-1:45pm): Friday, Dec 11, 1:30-4:30 p.m. -->

<!-- If you have a valid reason to request to take the the final exam during one of the conflict exam slots provided by CBTF, you can make the request directly via the CBTF website,
**before Dec 4**. I will not be approving any conflict request after this deadline, since we need to have sufficient time to make arrangements with the proctors. Missing the final exam will result in a zero grade, since we don't have makeup exams in this course. Make sure you make arrangements before this deadline!

**Conflict final exam slots provided by CBTF**

**Section M:** Saturday, Dec 12, 8:00am-11:00am OR Friday, Dec 18, 7:00pm-10:00pm

<!-- ### Taking Quizzes / Final Exam

Please familiarize yourself with the [policies of the
CBTF](https://cbtf.engr.illinois.edu/for-students/policies.html).
The policies of the CBTF are the policies of this course, and
academic integrity infractions related to the CBTF are infractions
in this course. Any problem with testing in the CBTF must be reported to CBTF staff
**at the time the problem occurs**. If you do not inform a proctor of a
problem during the test then you forfeit all rights to redress.


*   You must take your quizzes as scheduled with the CBTF, and only on
    the scheduled day and time. If you do not take the quiz (e.g. by not
    scheduling an appointment, by not reporting to the facility at the
    scheduled time, or by not performing the required work),
    the quiz will be counted as a zero.

*   There will be no exceptions to this scheduling policy except in
    cases of severe emergency (e.g., loss of life or limb). Examples of
    events that do not qualify as emergencies include (but are not limited
    to): transportation problems, conflict with work schedule, important
    family vacation, or computer problems. The policies of the facility
    apply during each quiz for aspects such as late arrival and emergency
    closures.

*   See the below section for appropriate documentation required
    for quizzes missed due to university-approved activities.

*   If you miss a quiz for any reason and you realize you missed it
    while it is still within the quiz period, then you must contact the CBTF
    proctors immediately.  If it is sill within the quiz period, then
    depending on the circumstances and pending availability, you may be able
    to reschedule.  If you fail to contact the proctors immediately, then
    you forfeit the opportunity to take the quiz.

*   **No aids** other than a writing utensil and paper provided by the facility are
    allowed in the CBTF. In particular: If you are seen *near* a phone, MP3 player or
    other digital device (turned on or not--it does not matter) during
    an quiz/exam, you will receive a grade of **zero** for the assessment.

*   Extended illnesses or emergencies should follow the policies outlined by
    the [Office of the Dean of Students](http://www.odos.uiuc.edu/community-of-care/emergency-dean/).

*   Only quizzes taken in accordance with these rules will receive
    credit. Any deviation from these rules will lead to the
    quiz in question being assigned a grade of **zero**.

*   **You are not allowed to discuss the quiz with other students during the quiz
    period.  Please refrain from discussing the questions until after the
    quiz period ends**. -->

<!-- #  How should I use the course resources?
---

I often get this question from students: "How can I study for this course?"  I will give here my recommendation,
based on observations, my own experience as student, and feedback received over the years. Of course, every student is
different, and the recommendations below may not apply to you.

1) Watch the pre-recorded videos and complete the short questions (PrairieLearn lecture activities).
    Some students prefer to read instead of watching videos. If that is your case, you can take a look at the lecture <b>slides</b>
    and/or <b>notes</b> from the <a href="/pages/resources.html">Resources page</a>.

2) Start the homework AFTER you go over the course content and have a good understanding of the material. Use the homework to
      test your knowledge. Go back and review the concepts when you get a questions marked as incorrect. I know it can be tempting to just
      keep trying until you get the question marked as correct (the so desirable PrairieLearn green badge!),
      but you will be missing the opportunity to actually learn from your mistakes.

3) Watch the pre-recorded videos before the corresponding group activities. You will have more productive and interesting
conversations with your team mates if you know the content.

4) When preparing for the quizzes, take a look at the <b>review questions</b> from the <a href="/pages/resources.html">Resources page</a>..
  They may help you figuring out what you know and what you still
need to learn. Go back to the videos, slides and/or notes from concepts that you have not mastered yet.

5) This semester I am making **Practice Quizzes** available. Don't start creating your Practice Quizzes until you completed the steps above. This is a great opportunity to really see how well you have learned the material before you take your actual quiz. -->
