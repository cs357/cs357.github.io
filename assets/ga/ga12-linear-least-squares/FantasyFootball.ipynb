    "# A Least Squares Predictor for Fantasy Football\n",

    "In Fantasy Football, contestants choose from a pool of available (American) football players to build a team.  Contestants' teams score points depending on how their chosen players performed in real-life.  The more points scored, the better!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are literally hundreds of websites and blogs dedicated to predicting who will have a good game.  They use a variety of methodologies (including no methodology at all) to generate their predictions.  We will try to develop a predictor using Linear Least Squares that will answer the question: \"Should I pick this player?\""

Ryan Fitzpatrick only took 25.0 \"dollars\" of your available budget if you selected him on your team.  It gives an indication of how the platform judges the quality of a player."
